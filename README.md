# WDL via OnDemand

The command line is dead to me, long live pipeline submission via eyeball tracking.

Developed as part of the [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital KIDS25 BioHackathon](https://github.com/stjude-biohackathon) by Team 8, mostly by [@walidabualafia](https://github.com/walidabualafia) with minor changes by [@j-andrews7](https://github.com/j-andrews7).

## Can I use this for my OnDemand instance?

Sure, but no guarantees. This was designed for an LSF filesystem and HPC environment, so your mileage may vary.
