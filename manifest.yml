description: >
  This app allows users to launch properly configured jobs to run Nextflow pipelines with the LSF executor backend. 
  You are required to input a `params` JSON or YAML file with pipeline inputs. 
  If a task fails due to running out of memory, it will automatically be retried with twice the memory (up to three times).
  Runs that previously failed can be resumed by reusing the same "Run Unique Name" to pick up where they left off.
  While designed for [nf-core pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines/), 
  this app should be able to run any Nextflow pipeline with [minor modifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/external_usage/nf-core_configs_outside_nf-core)
  to utilize the [St. Jude nf-core institutional config profile](https://nf-co.re/configs/stjude/).
